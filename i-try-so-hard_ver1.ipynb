 Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering üîß\n\nPerform data preprocessing and feature engineering operations on the training data.\n\n**1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**\n- `df_train = feature_eng(**data_store)`: Applies feature engineering to the training data stored in the `data_store` dictionary using the `feature_eng` function. The unpacking operator `**` is used to pass the dictionary as keyword arguments.\n- `del data_store`: Deletes the `data_store` dictionary to release memory.\n- `gc.collect()`: Manually triggers garbage collection to free up memory space.\n\n **2. Data Filtering, Conversion, and Memory Reduction**\n- `df_train = df_train.pipe(Pipeline.filter_cols)`: Applies column filtering using the `filter_cols` method from the `Pipeline` class to the `df_train` DataFrame using the `pipe` method.\n- `df_train, cat_cols = to_pandas(df_train)`: Converts the `df_train` DataFrame to Pandas DataFrame and retrieves the categorical column names. It uses the `to_pandas` function for conversion.\n- `df_train = reduce_mem_usage(df_train)`: Reduces memory usage of the `df_train` DataFrame using the `reduce_mem_usage` function to optimize memory consumption.\n\n **3. Handling Missing Values**\n- `nums = df_train.select_dtypes(exclude='category').columns`: Selects numerical columns (excluding categorical columns) from the DataFrame and stores their column names in the `nums` variable.\n- `from itertools import combinations, permutations`: Imports the `combinations` and `permutations` functions from the `itertools` module.\n- `nans_df = df_train[nums].isna()`: Creates a DataFrame `nans_df` to identify missing values in numerical columns.\n- `nans_groups = {}`: Initializes an empty dictionary to store numerical columns grouped by the count of missing values.\n- Loops through each numerical column (`col`) and calculates the count of missing values for each column. Then, it groups the columns based on the count of missing values in the `nans_groups` dictionary.\n\n **4. Memory Management**\n- `del nans_df`: Deletes the `nans_df` DataFrame to release memory.\n- `x = gc.collect()`: Manually triggers garbage collection to free up memory space.\n\n### Study Sources\n-

üîÑHandling Missing Values and Reducing Columns Based on Correlation\n\nLet's processes the `nans_groups` dictionary to handle missing values and reduce columns based on their correlation. \n### Explanation of Code\n\n1. **Initialization**\n   - `uses = []`: Initializes an empty list `uses` to store the final list of selected columns.\n\n2. **Iterate through Groups in `nans_groups`**\n   - `for k, v in nans_groups.items()`: Iterates through the `nans_groups` dictionary where `k` is the key (number of missing values) and `v` is the list of column names with that number of missing values.\n\n3. **Processing Each Group**\n   - **For Groups with More Than One Column**:\n     - `if len(v) > 1`: Checks if the group contains more than one column.\n       - `Vs = nans_groups[k]`: Assigns the list of columns `v` to `Vs`.\n       - `grps = group_columns_by_correlation(df_train[Vs], threshold=0.8)`: Groups columns in `Vs` based on their correlation using a threshold of 0.8.\n       - `use = reduce_group(grps)`: Reduces the groups by selecting columns with the highest number of unique values using the `reduce_group` function.\n       - `uses = uses + use`: Appends the selected columns to the `uses` list.\n   - **For Groups with a Single Column**:\n     - `else`: If the group contains only one column,\n       - `uses = uses + v`: Directly appends the column to the `uses` list.\n### Study Sources\n\n- **Handling Missing Data in Pandas**: [Pandas Documentation on Handling Missing Data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html)\n-

required Parquet files. The structure and logic mirror those used for the training set, ensuring consistency in data preprocessing.\n### Explanation of Code\n\n1. **Reading Base and Depth Data for Test Set**:\n    - **Base Data**:\n      - `df_base`: Reads the base data from the Parquet file located at `TEST_DIR / \"test_base.parquet\"`.\n    - **Depth 0 Data**:\n      - `depth_0`: Reads the static credit bureau data from individual and wildcard Parquet files located at `TEST_DIR / \"test_static_cb_0.parquet\"` and `TEST_DIR / \"test_static_0_*.parquet\"`.\n    - **Depth 1 Data**:\n      - `depth_1`: Reads various related data files such as application previous, tax registry, credit bureau, and other related data files, all with depth 1, from their respective Parquet files.\n    - **Depth 2 Data**:\n      - `depth_2`: Reads the credit bureau data with depth 2 from the Parquet file located at `TEST_DIR / \"test_credit_bureau_b_2.parquet\"`.\n\n\n### Study Sources\n\n1. **Reading Parquet Files**:\n   - [Pandas Documentation on Reading Parquet Files](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_parquet.html)\n   - [Polars Documentation on Reading Parquet Files](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/py-polars/html/reference/io.html#polars.read_parquet)\n2. **File Handling and Wildcards**:\n   - [Python glob Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html)\n3. **Data Preprocessing Techniques**:\n   - [Pandas User Guide on Data Preprocessing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/preprocessing.html)\n   - [Polars User Guide on DataFrame Operations](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/py-polars/html/user-guide/index.html)\n\n### Explanation of Concepts\n\n- **Parquet Files**: A columnar storage file format optimized for use with large-scale data processing frameworks.\n- **Data Preprocessing**: The process of transforming raw data into an understandable format. Includes reading data, handling missing values, and selecting relevant features.\n- **Wildcards in File Paths**: Used to specify patterns in file names. For example, `test_static_0_*.parquet` matches all files starting with `test_static_0_` and ending with `.parquet`.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nTEST_DIR  =

Feature Engineering and Data Preparation for the Test Set üöÄ\n\nPerforms feature engineering and data preparation on the test set. It follows the same steps as for the training set, ensuring consistency in data processing. \n\n### Explanation of Code\n\n1. **Feature Engineering**:\n    - `df_test = feature_eng(**data_store)`: Applies the `feature_eng` function to the test data stored in `data_store`. This function performs various feature engineering steps, such as creating new features and joining different depth data based on `case_id`.\n\n2. **Memory Management**:\n    - `del data_store`: Deletes the `data_store` dictionary to free up memory.\n    - `gc.collect()`: Calls the garbage collector to release any unreferenced memory.\n\n3. **Selecting Relevant Columns**:\n    - `df_test = df_test.select([col for col in df_train.columns if col != \"target\"])`: Selects columns in `df_test` that match the columns in `df_train`, excluding the \"target\" column. This ensures that the test set has the same features as the training set.\n\n4. **Conversion to Pandas DataFrame and Category Data Type**:\n    - `df_test, cat_cols = to_pandas(df_test)`: Converts the `df_test` Polars DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame and converts specified columns to the \"category\" data type to save memory.\n\n5. **Memory Usage Reduction**:\n    - `df_test = reduce_mem_usage(df_test)`: Applies the `reduce_mem_usage` function to reduce the memory footprint of the Pandas DataFrame by converting columns to more efficient data types.\n\n6. **Final Memory Management**:\n    - `gc.collect()`: Calls the garbage collector again to release any unreferenced memory after data processing.\n\n### Study Sources\n\n1. **Feature Engineering**:\n   - [Feature Engineering for Machine Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/)\n2. **Memory Management**:\n   - [Python Memory Management](https://realpython.com/python-memory-management/)\n   - [Garbage Collection in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html)\n3. **DataFrame Selection**:\n   - [Pandas DataFrame Indexing and Selecting Data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html)\n4. **Data Type Conversion in Pandas**:\n   - [Pandas Data Types and Memory Usage](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/basics.html#basics-dtypes)\n\n### Explanation of Concepts\n\n- **Feature Engineering**: The process of using domain knowledge to create features (variables) that make machine learning algorithms work. It includes creating new features, transforming existing ones, and joining data from different sources.\n- **Garbage Collection**: A form of automatic memory management that reclaims memory occupied by objects no longer in use by the program.\n- **Data Type Conversion**: Changing the data type of columns to more efficient types (e.g., from `float64` to `float32`) to save memory and improve performance.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_test = feature_eng(**data_store)\ndel data_store\ngc.collect()\ndf_test = df_test.select([col for col in df_train.columns if col !=
